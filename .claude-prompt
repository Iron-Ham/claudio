# Task: Add tests verifying interface implementations

## Part of Ultra-Plan: Extract prompt-building logic (buildTaskPrompt, buildPlanManagerPrompt, buildPlanComparisonSection) from coordinator.go into the existing orchestrator/prompt package by creating type conversion helpers and updating the coordinator to use the existing TaskBuilder and PlanningBuilder. This removes ~200 lines from coordinator.go while improving testability.

## Your Task

Add tests to verify that orchestrator types properly implement the prompt package interfaces.

In `internal/orchestrator/ultraplan_test.go`, add test functions:

1. TestPlannedTaskImplementsInterface - verify *PlannedTask satisfies PlannedTaskLike
2. TestPlanSpecImplementsInterface - verify *PlanSpec satisfies PlanSpecLike  
3. TestGroupConsolidationImplementsInterface - verify *GroupConsolidationCompletionFile satisfies GroupConsolidationLike

Each test should:
- Create an instance of the type with test data
- Assign it to a variable of the interface type (compile-time check)
- Call each getter method and verify the returned values match

Example pattern:
```go
func TestPlannedTaskImplementsInterface(t *testing.T) {
    task := &PlannedTask{
        ID: "test-1",
        Title: "Test Task",
        // ... other fields
    }
    
    // Compile-time interface check
    var _ prompt.PlannedTaskLike = task
    
    // Runtime verification
    if got := task.GetID(); got != "test-1" {
        t.Errorf("GetID() = %q, want %q", got, "test-1")
    }
    // ... verify other methods
}
```

## Expected Files

You are expected to work with these files:
- internal/orchestrator/ultraplan_test.go

## Context from Previous Group

This task builds on work consolidated from Group 1.

**Consolidator Notes**: Consolidated 4 task branches that lay groundwork for extracting prompt-building logic from coordinator.go. Task-1 adds conversion helper interfaces and functions (PlannedTaskLike, PlanSpecLike, GroupConsolidationLike). Task-3 adds StrategyNames context support to PlanningBuilder. Task-4 adds getter methods to orchestrator types to implement the interfaces. Task-12 adds the changelog entry. The branches had independent code changes but overlapping CHANGELOG.md entries which were merged cleanly.

**Important**: The previous group's consolidator flagged these issues:
- The prompt package now has conversion helpers (convert.go) and the orchestrator types have getter methods (ultraplan.go) - next step is to update the coordinator to use these for buildTaskPrompt, buildPlanManagerPrompt, and buildPlanComparisonSection
- The PromptAdapter in orchestrator/adapter.go may have overlapping functionality with the new ConvertPlannedTaskToTaskInfo and similar functions - consider consolidating
- The PlannedTaskLike interface is defined in both prompt/convert.go and orchestrator/ultraplan.go - this is intentional for duck typing but callers should be aware both exist

The consolidated code from the previous group has been verified (build/lint/tests passed).

## Guidelines

- Focus only on this specific task
- Do not modify files outside of your assigned scope unless necessary
- Commit your changes before writing the completion file

## Completion Protocol

When your task is complete, you MUST write a completion file to signal the orchestrator:

1. Use Write tool to create `.claudio-task-complete.json` in your worktree root
2. Include this JSON structure:
```json
{
  "task_id": "task-5-interface-tests",
  "status": "complete",
  "summary": "Brief description of what you accomplished",
  "files_modified": ["list", "of", "files", "you", "changed"],
  "notes": "Any implementation notes for the consolidation phase",
  "issues": ["Any concerns or blocking issues found"],
  "suggestions": ["Suggestions for integration with other tasks"],
  "dependencies": ["Any new runtime dependencies added"]
}
```

3. Use status "blocked" if you cannot complete (explain in issues), or "failed" if something broke
4. This file signals that your work is done and provides context for consolidation
