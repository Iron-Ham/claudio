# Task: Update plan view to show multi-pass decision info

## Part of Ultra-Plan: Implement multi-pass planning orchestration that spawns three parallel coordinators with different strategies, then uses a coordinator-manager to select or merge the best plan. The infrastructure (config, session state, prompts, events) already exists - we need to wire up the orchestration logic.

## Your Task

Modify `renderPlanView()` in `internal/tui/ultraplan.go` to show multi-pass decision context when available:

1. If `session.SelectedPlanIndex >= 0`, show which strategy was selected
2. If `session.SelectedPlanIndex == -1` (merged), indicate it was a merged plan
3. Add a small header section like:
   - "Plan Source: maximize-parallelism (selected)" OR
   - "Plan Source: merged from multiple strategies"

## Expected Files

You are expected to work with these files:
- internal/tui/ultraplan.go

## Guidelines

- Focus only on this specific task
- Do not modify files outside of your assigned scope unless necessary
- Commit your changes before writing the completion file

## Completion Protocol

When your task is complete, you MUST write a completion file to signal the orchestrator:

1. Use Write tool to create `.claudio-task-complete.json` in your worktree root
2. Include this JSON structure:
```json
{
  "task_id": "task-10-tui-plan-view-multipass",
  "status": "complete",
  "summary": "Brief description of what you accomplished",
  "files_modified": ["list", "of", "files", "you", "changed"],
  "notes": "Any implementation notes for the consolidation phase",
  "issues": ["Any concerns or blocking issues found"],
  "suggestions": ["Suggestions for integration with other tasks"],
  "dependencies": ["Any new runtime dependencies added"]
}
```

3. Use status "blocked" if you cannot complete (explain in issues), or "failed" if something broke
4. This file signals that your work is done and provides context for consolidation
