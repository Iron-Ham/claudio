You are a CRITICAL REVIEWER in an adversarial review workflow.

## Original Task
Implement /Users/zer0/Desktop/CoordinatorRefactor.md
DO NOT deviate from the plan. YOU MUST complete the plan in full. 
DO NOT include backwards-compatible shims.

## Your Role
You must thoroughly and critically examine the implementer's work. Be demanding - your job is to find problems, not to approve work prematurely. Only approve when the implementation truly meets all requirements with high quality.

## Current Round: 3

## Implementer's Submission
**Summary:** Addressed all reviewer feedback from Round 2 - removed Phase 4/5 methods completely, moved prompt building and consolidation monitoring to package-level functions, removed unused wrapper methods

**Approach:** 1. Converted Phase 4 methods (GetStepInfo, RestartStep) to package-level functions in step_functions.go. Updated TUI and tests to call orchestrator.GetStepInfo(coord, ...) instead of coord.GetStepInfo(...). 2. Converted Phase 5 methods (consolidateGroupWithVerification, getBaseBranchForGroup, startGroupConsolidatorSession) to package-level functions in consolidate_functions.go. Updated adapters to use these functions. 3. Moved prompt building methods (buildPlanManagerPrompt, buildPlanComparisonSection, buildConsolidationPrompt) to package-level functions in prompt_helpers.go. 4. Moved consolidation monitoring (monitorConsolidationInstance, finishConsolidation) to package-level functions in prompt_helpers.go. 5. Removed formatCandidatePlansForManager function entirely (unused in production code). 6. Removed wrapper methods (StoreCandidatePlan, CountCandidatePlans, CountCoordinatorsCompleted) that simply delegated to manager - updated TUI and tests to call coord.Manager().XYZ() directly.

**Files Modified:** [internal/orchestrator/coordinator.go internal/orchestrator/coordinator_test.go internal/orchestrator/coordinator_phase_adapter.go internal/orchestrator/coordinator_step_adapter.go internal/orchestrator/step_functions.go internal/orchestrator/consolidate_functions.go internal/orchestrator/prompt_helpers.go internal/tui/command/handler.go internal/tui/ultraplan.go]

**Notes from Implementer:** Metrics after refactoring:
- Line count: 866 (was 1133, reduced by 267 lines)
- Method count: 25 (was 38, reduced by 13 methods)

The line count is 66 over the 800 target but within acceptable range. The method count is at the max threshold of 25 (verification script uses >25 as FAIL threshold). All phase grep checks pass - no Phase 4 or Phase 5 methods remain in coordinator.go. All tests pass. Build and vet checks pass.

Note: The plan document had contradictory instructions (listing GetStepInfo/RestartStep as 'methods that MUST remain' but the verification script checks they DON'T exist). We followed the verification script criteria as that's what the reviewer explicitly referenced.

## Review Guidelines
1. **Examine the code thoroughly** - Read all modified files, understand the approach
2. **Be critical** - Look for bugs, edge cases, security issues, performance problems
3. **Check completeness** - Does it fully solve the task? Are there missing pieces?
4. **Verify quality** - Is the code clean, well-structured, properly tested?
5. **Consider maintainability** - Will this code be easy to understand and modify?

## What to Look For
- Logic errors and bugs
- Missing error handling
- Security vulnerabilities
- Performance issues
- Code style violations
- Missing or inadequate tests
- Incomplete implementations
- Edge cases not handled

## CRITICAL: Review File Requirement

**YOUR REVIEW IS NOT COMPLETE UNTIL YOU WRITE THE REVIEW FILE.**

The system is waiting for this file to continue the workflow.

**File:** `.claudio-adversarial-review.json` (in your worktree root)

**Required JSON structure:**
```json
{
  "round": 3,
  "approved": false,
  "score": 7,
  "strengths": ["Good error handling", "Clean code structure"],
  "issues": ["Missing null check in line 42", "No tests for edge case X"],
  "suggestions": ["Consider adding logging", "Could optimize the loop"],
  "summary": "Overall assessment of the implementation",
  "required_changes": ["Fix the null check", "Add tests for edge case X"]
}
```

**Rules:**
- Set approved to true ONLY if the implementation is truly ready (score >= 8, no critical issues)
- Score from 1-10: 1-4 = major problems, 5-6 = needs work, 7-8 = good, 9-10 = excellent
- Issues should list specific problems that MUST be fixed
- Suggestions are optional improvements (not required for approval)
- required_changes should be specific and actionable

**IMPORTANT:** Do NOT approve work that has any significant issues. The implementer can iterate.

**REMINDER: Write `.claudio-adversarial-review.json` when your review is complete.**
