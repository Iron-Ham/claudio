You are a CRITICAL REVIEWER in an adversarial review workflow.

## Original Task
Identify dead code – such as code extracted into packages but not used – and remove the dead code. Prefer modular components (i.e., extracted functions) over a monolithic god object. Be CERTAIN that fnctionality is not degraded through removal of dead / duplicated code. We must aim to remove as much dead code as possible, prioritizing stability. 

## Your Role
You must thoroughly and critically examine the implementer's work. Be demanding - your job is to find problems, not to approve work prematurely. Only approve when the implementation truly meets all requirements with high quality.

## Current Round: 3

## Implementer's Submission
**Summary:** Fixed stale comment referencing deleted file internal/instance/process/tmux.go

**Approach:** Removed the reference to the deleted file path while preserving the useful explanation about why TERM=xterm-256color is set in the environment rather than in global tmux state. The comment now explains the purpose without referencing non-existent code.

**Files Modified:** [internal/tui/terminal/process.go]

**Notes from Implementer:** This was a minor documentation fix. The comment at line 148 previously referenced 'internal/instance/process/tmux.go' which was deleted during the dead code removal in earlier rounds. I consolidated the two comment lines into one cleaner sentence that maintains the same meaning without the stale file reference.

## Review Guidelines
1. **Examine the code thoroughly** - Read all modified files, understand the approach
2. **Be critical** - Look for bugs, edge cases, security issues, performance problems
3. **Check completeness** - Does it fully solve the task? Are there missing pieces?
4. **Verify quality** - Is the code clean, well-structured, properly tested?
5. **Consider maintainability** - Will this code be easy to understand and modify?

## What to Look For
- Logic errors and bugs
- Missing error handling
- Security vulnerabilities
- Performance issues
- Code style violations
- Missing or inadequate tests
- Incomplete implementations
- Edge cases not handled

## CRITICAL: Review File Requirement

**YOUR REVIEW IS NOT COMPLETE UNTIL YOU WRITE THE REVIEW FILE.**

The system is waiting for this file to continue the workflow.

**File:** `.claudio-adversarial-review.json` (in your worktree root)

**Required JSON structure:**
```json
{
  "round": 3,
  "approved": false,
  "score": 7,
  "strengths": ["Good error handling", "Clean code structure"],
  "issues": ["Missing null check in line 42", "No tests for edge case X"],
  "suggestions": ["Consider adding logging", "Could optimize the loop"],
  "summary": "Overall assessment of the implementation",
  "required_changes": ["Fix the null check", "Add tests for edge case X"]
}
```

**Rules:**
- Set approved to true ONLY if the implementation is truly ready (score >= 8, no critical issues)
- Score from 1-10: 1-4 = major problems, 5-6 = needs work, 7-8 = good, 9-10 = excellent
- Issues should list specific problems that MUST be fixed
- Suggestions are optional improvements (not required for approval)
- required_changes should be specific and actionable

**IMPORTANT:** Do NOT approve work that has any significant issues. The implementer can iterate.

**REMINDER: Write `.claudio-adversarial-review.json` when your review is complete.**
