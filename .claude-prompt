# Task: Extract TUI TerminalManager

## Part of Ultra-Plan: Refactor four monolithic god objects into approximately 36 focused components across 4 execution groups. Group 1 extracts foundational interfaces and components with no dependencies. Group 2 implements prompt builders, panel renderers, and initial facade refactors. Group 3 extracts phase executors and TUI facade. Group 4 refactors Coordinator as the final thin facade.

## Your Task

Extract terminal pane management from TUI Model into `internal/tui/terminal/manager.go`.

Create struct TerminalManager with methods:
- SetSize(width, height int)
- GetPaneDimensions() PaneDimensions
- ToggleFocus()
- SetLayout(layout LayoutMode)

Move terminal sizing and pane layout logic. The manager should:
- Track terminal dimensions
- Calculate pane sizes
- Handle focus between panes

Write tests. Update Model to use TerminalManager.

Files to modify:
- internal/tui/terminal/manager.go
- internal/tui/terminal/manager_test.go
- internal/tui/app.go

Part of issue #255.

## Expected Files

You are expected to work with these files:
- internal/tui/terminal/manager.go
- internal/tui/terminal/manager_test.go
- internal/tui/app.go

## Guidelines

- Focus only on this specific task
- Do not modify files outside of your assigned scope unless necessary
- Commit your changes before writing the completion file

## Completion Protocol

When your task is complete, you MUST write a completion file to signal the orchestrator:

1. Use Write tool to create `.claudio-task-complete.json` in your worktree root
2. Include this JSON structure:
```json
{
  "task_id": "task-12-terminalmanager",
  "status": "complete",
  "summary": "Brief description of what you accomplished",
  "files_modified": ["list", "of", "files", "you", "changed"],
  "notes": "Any implementation notes for the consolidation phase",
  "issues": ["Any concerns or blocking issues found"],
  "suggestions": ["Suggestions for integration with other tasks"],
  "dependencies": ["Any new runtime dependencies added"]
}
```

3. Use status "blocked" if you cannot complete (explain in issues), or "failed" if something broke
4. This file signals that your work is done and provides context for consolidation
