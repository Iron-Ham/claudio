# Task: Add --issue flag to ultraplan command

## Part of Ultra-Plan: Enable ingesting GitHub Issues as UltraPlan execution plans via a new --issue CLI flag. This requires extending the existing ingestion pipeline to support human-authored (freeform) issue formats in addition to the current templated format, plus CLI integration to wire the feature end-to-end.

## Your Task

Add a new --issue flag to the ultraplan CLI command that accepts a GitHub issue URL or shorthand (owner/repo#123). When provided, the plan is loaded from the GitHub issue instead of being generated.

Modify internal/cmd/ultraplan.go:
- Add `ultraplanIssueURL string` variable
- Add flag: `--issue` with description 'Load plan from GitHub issue URL'
- In runUltraplan():
  - If --issue is set, call plan.BuildPlanFromURL()
  - Use the returned PlanSpec instead of generating one
  - Set objective from parent issue title
  - Skip planning phase (jump to PhaseRefresh)
- Add validation that --issue and --plan are mutually exclusive

Update command help text with examples.

## Expected Files

You are expected to work with these files:
- internal/cmd/ultraplan.go

## Context from Previous Group

This task builds on work consolidated from Group 4.

**Consolidator Notes**: Successfully consolidated task-5-build-plan-freeform which completes the auto-detection support for the ingestion pipeline. The commit adds DetectParentIssueFormat() and ParseParentIssueBodyAuto() functions that mirror the sub-issue auto-detection pattern from group-3. The buildPlanFromGitHubIssue() and convertSubIssuesToTasks() functions now use auto-detection, enabling full support for all combinations of templated and freeform parent/sub-issues. Cherry-pick applied cleanly with no conflicts.

**Important**: The previous group's consolidator flagged these issues:
- The freeform parser infers complexity (defaults to medium) when not explicitly specified - document this behavior for users
- Dependency extraction from freeform bodies finds all #N references inline - could document that users can mention dependencies naturally in prose
- Consider adding CLI documentation for the --issue flag to explain that both templated (Claudio-generated) and freeform (human-authored) issues are supported
- With Groups 1-4 complete, the ingestion pipeline is fully functional - next steps would be CLI integration to expose the --issue flag to users

The consolidated code from the previous group has been verified (build/lint/tests passed).

## Guidelines

- Focus only on this specific task
- Do not modify files outside of your assigned scope unless necessary
- Commit your changes before writing the completion file

## Completion Protocol

When your task is complete, you MUST write a completion file to signal the orchestrator:

1. Use Write tool to create `.claudio-task-complete.json` in your worktree root
2. Include this JSON structure:
```json
{
  "task_id": "task-6-cli-issue-flag",
  "status": "complete",
  "summary": "Brief description of what you accomplished",
  "files_modified": ["list", "of", "files", "you", "changed"],
  "notes": "Any implementation notes for the consolidation phase",
  "issues": ["Any concerns or blocking issues found"],
  "suggestions": ["Suggestions for integration with other tasks"],
  "dependencies": ["Any new runtime dependencies added"]
}
```

3. Use status "blocked" if you cannot complete (explain in issues), or "failed" if something broke
4. This file signals that your work is done and provides context for consolidation
