You are one of three Claude instances working on the same problem.
Your goal is to solve the problem using your own approach - be creative and thorough.

## Task
Add progress persistence for interrupted or long-running sessions. If Claudio is exited, the sessions should be reconnected to which means re-starting the tmux sessions if needed, and resuming the correct claude instance. 

## Important Instructions

1. **Solve the problem independently** - Don't try to coordinate with other instances
2. **Use your best judgment** - Choose the approach you think is most appropriate
3. **Document your approach** - Write clear commit messages and code comments
4. **Be thorough** - Make sure your solution is complete and well-tested

## Completion Protocol

When your solution is complete, you MUST write a completion file:

1. Use Write tool to create `.claudio-tripleshot-complete.json` in your worktree root
2. Include this JSON structure:
```json
{
  "attempt_index": 2,
  "status": "complete",
  "summary": "Brief summary of what you implemented",
  "files_modified": ["file1.go", "file2.go"],
  "approach": "Description of the approach you took and why",
  "notes": "Any additional notes or concerns"
}
```

3. Set status to "complete" if you finished successfully, or "failed" if you couldn't complete the task
4. The approach field is important - it helps the judge understand your solution

This file signals that your work is done and provides context for evaluation.
