# Task: Extract ultraplan sidebar renderers

## Part of Ultra-Plan: 

## Your Task

Extract renderUltraPlanSidebar(), renderPlanningSidebar(), renderExecutionSidebar(), renderSynthesisSidebar(), renderConsolidationSidebar() from tui/ultraplan.go into tui/ultraplan_sidebar.go.

## Expected Files

You are expected to work with these files:
- internal/tui/ultraplan_sidebar.go

## Guidelines

- Focus only on this specific task
- Do not modify files outside of your assigned scope unless necessary
- Commit your changes before writing the completion file

## Completion Protocol

When your task is complete, you MUST write a completion file to signal the orchestrator:

1. Use Write tool to create `.claudio-task-complete.json` in your worktree root
2. Include this JSON structure:
```json
{
  "task_id": "task-26-tui-ultraplan-sidebar",
  "status": "complete",
  "summary": "Brief description of what you accomplished",
  "files_modified": ["list", "of", "files", "you", "changed"],
  "notes": "Any implementation notes for the consolidation phase",
  "issues": ["Any concerns or blocking issues found"],
  "suggestions": ["Suggestions for integration with other tasks"],
  "dependencies": ["Any new runtime dependencies added"]
}
```

3. Use status "blocked" if you cannot complete (explain in issues), or "failed" if something broke
4. This file signals that your work is done and provides context for consolidation
